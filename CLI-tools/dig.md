# DNS lookup utility
Used to manually query *recursive [DNS](/networking/DNS/DNS.md) servers* for info about domains.
## Usage: 
```
dig  [@server] [-b address] [-c class] [-f filename] [-k filename] [-m]
       [-p port#] [-q name] [-t type] [-v] [-x addr]  [-y  [hmac:]name:key]  [
       [-4] | [-6] ] [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]
```  
```
dig <domain> @<dns-server-ip>
```

### `ANSWER` section: 
Contains the IP address you're looking for.
### `TTL` (Time to Live)
When your computer queries a domain name, it stores the result in local cache. The TTL tells your computer *when to stop considering the record as valid* (when it should request the data again).

The TTL is measured in seconds. So for this example, the record expires in 2 minutes and 30 seconds
## Usage Examples
### `+short`
Giving the `+short` flag will shorten dig's output:
```bash
└─# dig +short ns1.megacorpone.com
51.79.37.18
```
### Reverse lookups
The `-x` option will tell dig to do a reverse DNS lookup of the provided IP address. Dig will treat this as if you're querying for the [PTR record](../networking/DNS/PTR-record.md) of the specified IP address.
```bash
└─# dig -x 51.79.37.18

; <<>> DiG 9.19.19-1-Debian <<>> -x 51.79.37.18
