# Password Spraying
Init.
Password spraying is a kind of password attack which attackers use to try to brute force hundreds of logins without triggering detection. Instead of brute-forcing the password of a single account, password spraying uses one *common password* (like "Summer2025!) to try and login for multiple accounts. The idea is that out of hundreds or thousands of attempts, a handful will be successful since some of the victims are likely to be using that common password.
