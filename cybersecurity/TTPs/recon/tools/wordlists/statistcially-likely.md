# Statistically Likely wordlists
A repo of text files which are large lists of statistically likely usernames. Each list includes usernames with different *combos of first and last name*. For example, the `jsmith.txt` file includes usernames with a first initial, last name format like `bdover`, whereas the `johnsmith.txt` file has usernames with a first name, last name format like `bendover`.
