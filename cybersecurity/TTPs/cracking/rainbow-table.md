# Rainbow table
A rainbow-table is a [database](../../../coding/databases/DBMS.md) of pre-computed plain-text passwords and their corresponding [hash](../../../computers/concepts/cryptography/hashing.md) values. Used to find out what hash is produced from which plain-text password

***multiple texts can produce the same hash***
