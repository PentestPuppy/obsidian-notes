Named after the Trojan Horse from Greek history and the taking or Troy. As a malware, a trojan is software which is *disguised as harmless software* but is actually malicious. Usually, trojan malware tricks a user into executing it by, not only appearing to look harmless, but even *performing a desired function* for the user (while also doing something malicious).
## Remote Access Trojan
This is a more modern type of trojan which *allows an attacker to take remote control* of the machine it's on.
