# Metasploit
Metasploit Framework is an open-source set of tools which can be used for information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post exploitation, etc.. Primary use is for ethical hacking/ pen-testing.
## Main components:
### `msfconsole`
Main CL interface.
### Modules
Modules are anything which is packaged up and can be used to perform a specific task:
- Exploits: piece of code which uses a vulnerability in a target system
- Payload: the code which runs on a target system once it has been accessed maliciously (via an exploit)
- Evasions: these modules attempt to evade antivirus software.
- Post: Post modules are useful on the final stage of a penetration test b/c they help cleanup any leftover evidence from the exploit/ payload/ etc.
- Auxiliary: Any supporting modules like scanners, crawlers, fuzzers, etc.
### Encoders
Allow you to encode an exploit and payload so that it won't be detected by a signature-based antivirus 
#### Signature-Based Antivirus 
Software which uses a DB of known threats which they use to detect suspicious files (by comparing them to the DB). Even with encoders, the *success rate is limited* b/c antivirus software can use *other checks* to detect malicious software.
### NOPs (No Operations)
`NOP`s are pieces of code which are designed to literally do nothing and are used as buffers to achieve consistent payload sizes. The `NOP`s used in Metasploit are represented by Intel x86 CPU family.
## Creating a shell:
Metasploit offers payloads which can open shells on a target system. A [shell](/PNPT/PEH/exploit-basics/shells.md) is a persistent, interactive connection b/w an "attacker" (or Metasploit/ msfconsole) and the target machine which allows for the execution of commands on the target system.
## Types of Payloads:
In msfconsole, under ``payloads`` there are 3 different directories:
### Singles 
Self-contained payloads which don't need to download any other components to run.
### Stagers 
Used w/ 'staged' payloads to set up a connection channel b/w Metasploit and the target system. Staged payloads will upload a stager first on the target, then download the rest of the payload (the stage). This is useful because *the initial size of the payload will be smaller than the full payload*
### Stages
Payloads downloaded by the stager, allows for larger payload sizes. 
## Tools
Stand-alone tools which help w/ vulnerability finding/ research/ assessment and penetration testing. Some examples of tools included in Metasploit are `msfvenom` and [pattern create](/PNPT/PEH/buffer-overflows/pattern-create.md).
