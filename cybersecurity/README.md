# Cybersecurity
This is a large directory containing all my notes r/t cybersecurity (not including my [PNPT notes](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/PNPT-study-guide)). I've tried to organize them based loosely on the [Cyber Kill Chain](/cybersecurity/TTPs/cyber-kill-chain.md). The bulk of the interesting stuff can be found in [Tools](/cybersecurity/tools) and [TTPs](/cybersecurity/TTPs).

Here is a short breakdown of each section:
### [Adversaries](/cybersecurity/adversaries)
Includes notes on specific adversaries such as APT groups.
### [Attacks](/cybersecurity/attacks)
Contains notes about specific, noteworthy incidents like [WannaCry](/cybersecurity/attacks/wannacry.md).
### [Bug Bounties](/cybersecurity/bug-bounties)
May change in the future, right now just includes my notes from HackerOne's Hacker101 course.
### [Defense](/cybersecurity/defense)
Contains notes on different defensive/ blue team techniques. For example, [firewalls](/cybersecurity/defense/firewalls.md) and [DMARC](/cybersecurity/defense/DMARC.md).
### [Hardware Hacking](/cybersecurity/hardware-hacking)
Notes relating specifically to hardware. Right now all it contains is my notes on how radio frequencies work, lol. More to come.
### [Literature](/cybsersecurity/literature)
Contains links to resources like [Akamai](/cybersecurity/literature/Akamai.md) and [OWASP](/cybersecurity/literature/OWASP.md) as well as conceptual notes on things like [CVEs](/cybersecurity/literature/CVEs.md) and [CVSS](/cybersecurity/literature/CVSS.md).
### [Malware](/cybersecurity/malware)
Holds my notes related to specific, common/ noteworthy malware such as [Emotet](/cybersecurity/malware/emotet.md).
### [Opsec](/cybersecurity/opsec)
Contains miscellaneous notes r/t opsec practices.
### [Pen Testing](/cybersecurity/pen-testing)
Contains notes related to penetration testing practices like [report writing](/cybersecurity/pen-testing/report-writing.md), etc..
### [Resources](/cybersecurity/resources)
Sort of a miscellaneous directory of resources I come across. Right now it includes notes I've taken while working through resources like [corelan](/cybersecurity/resources/corelan) or even [VulnHub](/cybersecurity/resources/vulnhub.md).
### [Tools](/cybersecurity/tools)
This directory is LARGE and includes all of my notes on cybersecurity-specific tools. Each tool is organized into a sub-directory based loosely on the cyber kill chain.
### [TTPs](/cybersecurity/TTPs)
This directory is also large, and is also organized based on the Cyber Kill Chain. It includes all my notes regarding specific attack stages, vectors, patterns, etc..
### [Vulnerabilities](/cybersecurity/vulnerabilities)
This holds my notes on various specific vulnerabilities. For example [eternalblue](/cybersecurity/vulnerabilities/eternalblue.md) and [openfuck](/cybersecurity/vulnerabilities/openfuck.md).
