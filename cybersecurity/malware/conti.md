# Conti Ransomware
The name Conti is used to describe a [ransomware](../TTPs/actions-on-objective/ransomware.md) which, after first being discovered in 2019, has since developed into an entire *Ransomware as a Service* (RaaS) operation. The original authors, a group called 'Wizard Spider', are likely at the center of the operation, which also employs recruited affiliates.

The Conti malware, once deployed on a victim device, not only encrypts data on the device, but also spreads to other devices on the network, obfuscates its presence, and provides a remote attacker control over its actions on the objective. All versions of Microsoft Windows are known to be affected
## RaaS model
According to a [leaked playbook](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/conti-leak-translation/), core team-members of the Conti operation manage the malware itself, while recruited affiliates are tasked with exploitation of victim networks and encryption of their devices.

Conti's RaaS model varies in its structure from a typical affiliate model. Unlike other RaaS models, groups using the Conti model likely pay deployers of the malware in wages rather than in a percentage of the ransom (once paid).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-7) Conti operators have also been known to use double-extortion as a means to pressure victims into paying, including publishing the victim's stolen data. In cases where a victim organization refuses to pay, they've sold access to the organization to other threat actors.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-8)
### Tactics and Techniques
Conti ransomware employs various stealth techniques, including the use of BazarLoader, to infiltrate its target systems. The ransomware is designed to encrypt files and render them inaccessible until a ransom is paid. It is often delivered through [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing "Phishing") emails, exploit kits, or compromised websites.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-:0-1) Conti has gained notoriety for targeting healthcare institutions, as seen in its attacks on organizations in [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland "Ireland") and [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-:022-9)

The Conti group has also been known to sell access to victim organizations that have refused to pay the [ransom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom "Ransom"). This practice not only adds another layer of pressure on victims but also provides an additional source of revenue for the ransomware gang. These tactics, combined with the group's sophisticated techniques, have made Conti one of the most prolific and capable ransomware groups operating in 2021.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-:022-9)

The software uses its own implementation of [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard") that uses up to 32 individual logical threads, making it much faster than most ransomware.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-nhs-digital-conti-3) The method of delivery is not clear.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-nhs-digital-conti-3)

The gang behind Conti has operated a site from which it can leak documents copied by the ransomware since 2020.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-zdnet-conti-10) The same gang has operated the [Ryuk ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryuk_(ransomware) "Ryuk (ransomware)").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-zdnet-conti-10) The group is known as [Wizard Spider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_Spider "Wizard Spider") and is based in [Saint Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg "Saint Petersburg"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-tr-ireland_hse_ransomware_hospital_conti_wizardspider-11)

Once on a system it will try to delete [Volume Shadow Copies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Copy "Shadow Copy").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-nhs-digital-conti-3) It will try to terminate a number of services using [Restart Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restart_Manager "Restart Manager") to ensure it can encrypt files used by them.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-nhs-digital-conti-3) It will disable real time monitor and uninstall the Windows Defender application. Default behaviour is to encrypt all files on local and networked [Server Message Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block "Server Message Block") drives, ignoring files with [DLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library "Dynamic-link library"), [.exe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.exe ".exe"), [.sys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.sys ".sys") and [.lnk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.lnk ".lnk") extensions.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-nhs-digital-conti-3) It is also able to target specific drives as well as individual IP addresses.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-nhs-digital-conti-3)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-zdnet-conti-ransomware-uses-32-simultaneous-cpu-threads-12)

According to [NHS Digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Digital "NHS Digital") the only guaranteed way to recover is to restore all affected files from their most recent backup.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conti_(ransomware)#cite_note-nhs-digital-conti-3)
