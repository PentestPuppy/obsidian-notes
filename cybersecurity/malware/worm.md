# Worms
Worms are pieces of software which can replicate across a network *without any user interaction*. The difference between worms and [viruses](../../../cybersecurity/malware/viruses.md) is that viruses *require user interaction* such as clicking a malicious, link, opening a file, or connecting and infected external device.

Unlike viruses, worms replicate across multiple systems by taking advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in a network or ecosystem. They can even spread beyond the network they began in and infect computers around the entire world (usually if they all share the same vulnerabilities).
## Effects
Worms tend to have the following disruptive effects on a system:
- infecting work stations and other computer assets
- disrupt normal network traffic
## Historic Worms
### Nimda
In 2001, the Nimda worm was able to replicate across the entire internet in *22 minutes*, even though most internet connections at the time were dial-up.
### Conficker
in 2009, Conficker was a worm which was able to infect between *nine and fifteen million machines* which is still the *largest worm to date*. It was able to do this by exploiting a vulnerability in Windows file and printer sharing software. There was a patch out for this (Microsoft 08-067)  but theses machines did not have it applied.

Conficker would *scan every resource on the network* and when it found a device with this unpatched vuln, it would execute malicious code and take over that computer. Each computer then became *part of its [botnet](../../../cybersecurity/TTPs/c2/botnet.md)*.
