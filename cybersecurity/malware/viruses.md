# Viruses
Malicious code which is run on a machine w/o the user's knowledge. Allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has to be run. Usually *requires action from the user* and is able to spread to other devices on a network.
## Types
There are (at least) 10 different types of viruses.
### Boot Sector
This type of virus is *stored in the first sector* of a hard drive and is loaded into memory *whenever the computer boots up*. They are *very difficult to detect* because they're installed *before your OS boots*. This allows them to hide from anti-virus software.

Removing boot sector viruses usually requires using an anti-virus software *specifically designed* to find and remove them. These are usually ran from a network anti-virus scanning machine or can be loaded from a *live boot disc.*
### Macro Virus
Macros are a form of code which are embedded in another document and loaded when that document is opened. Macro viruses are viruses which are embedded in macros, and so are *loaded up with them and executed* when the document is opened.
#### Microsoft Word/ Excel/ PowerPoint
Microsoft office documents are *the most common* place to find these viruses. This is because Office software allows for macros so users can add functionality to the apps.
### Program Viruses
Viruses which try to *find executables* or application files to infect w/ their malicious code. For example, if a program virus you accidentally downloaded from the internet infects Microsoft Word, anytime you open Word, it will also execute the virus.
### Multipartite Virus
A virus which is a combination of a boot sector virus and a program virus. This type of virus normally installs *like a boot sector virus*, and then, when your computer boots, it will *find an application to install itself on* (like a program virus) so it gets executed w/ that program.

These viruses are more difficult to find and remove because *they establish persistence* on the device. If it gets removed from the program, then on the next boot, it will just find another program to attach itself to.
### Encrypted Virus
Encrypted viruses are designed to hide themselves from being detected by *encrypting its malicious payloads.* This allows them to avoid detection from *anti-virus software*. This is because a lot of anti-virus software uses techniques like file hashes to identify malicious content which has already been ID'd by other professionals in the field.

However, anti-virus software is improving, so even though this used to work as a means of evading detection, it's *not as effective* anymore. 
### Polymorphic Virus
An advanced version of an encrypted virus, but instead of just encrypting the malicious contents in the payload, it will *change the virus' code ea time it executes* (usually by altering the encryption module).  This makes it harder to detect *for signature based detection* because changing the code *changes the hash of the virus/file*.
#### Metamorphic Virus
A virus which is able to re-write itself entirely *before* attempting to infect another file. This is a *more advanced* version of a polymorphic virus.
### Stealth Virus
This is a virus *technique* rather than a type of virus. It encompasses techniques which viruses use to avoid anti-virus software.
### Armored Virus
Armored Viruses have a layer of protection meant to *confuse* the program or person trying to analyze it.
### Hoax
A hoax virus is one which employs a form of *social engineering* to attempt to scare a victim into taking an *undesirable action on their own system*. This is not technically an actual virus, but a form of manipulation of a victim by an attacker. 

For example, while browsing the internet, you may come across a pop-up which is 'from the *Microsoft Tech Support team*'  telling you you need to upgrade your antivirus software because your computer is infected. The pop up will give you steps to follow to 'get rid of the virus', when in reality, the steps they're leading you through are tricking you into downloading and installing a virus. This is used commonly in phone scams to get a victim to *pay money* to the attacker.
