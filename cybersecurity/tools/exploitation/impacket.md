# Python Impacket
Init.

Python [impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/tree/master) is an open-source collection of scripts designed to interact with common [networking](networking/OSI/network-layer.md) protocols. Many of the scripts can be used in pen-testing, especially against Windows targets.
## Common Scripts:
(I'm keeping a list here for my own use/ reference)
### [`smbrelayx.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbrelayx.py)
### [`ntlmrelayx.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py)
`ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -c 'whoami'`
- `tf`: target file
- `-smb2support`: support SMB version 2
- `-c`: command to execute on target system
- `-i`: interactive (will give you a shell)
### [`GetNPUsers.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py)
### [`GetUserSPNs.py`](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py)
