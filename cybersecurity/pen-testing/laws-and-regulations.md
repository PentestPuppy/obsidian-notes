## USA
### [Computer Fraud & Abuse Act](https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-48000-computer-fraud) (CFAA)
Generally makes it a criminal offense to *access a computer w/o authorization*. Lots of criticism b/c it could be used against security researchers. Additionally, people argue that its definitions are broad enough that they could be used to prosecute activities which were not intended to be criminal. It has also been criticized for the terms used within it which some argue need better clarification. 
### [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/2281) (DMCA)
Outlines how digital and technological works are protected by copyright. Becomes important for pen-testing when it relates to security research. Security researchers should be careful to ensure their activities don't violate copyright laws such as by circumventing copyright measures.
### [Electronics Communications Privacy Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/4952)(ECPA)
Deals with the *interception of electronic communication* as well as the access, storage, and monitoring of it. In general, it's illegal to intercept electronic communication without consent from both parties. Communication intercepted illegally cannot be used in a court of law as evidence.
### [Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-portability-accountability-act-1996) (HIPAA)
Governs how health information, including in electronic forms, is used, stored, and disclosed. 
### [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa) (COPPA)
Regulates the personal information of children *under the age of 13*. As it relates to pen-testing, it's important for researchers to make sure they aren't inadvertently including data from people under the age of 13 in their research.
