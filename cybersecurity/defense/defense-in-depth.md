# Defense in Depth
Defense in Depth is primarily a *military defensive strategy* which relies on the tendency for attacks *to loses momentum* over time and as it covers a larger area. The basic idea is that, instead of *preventing an attack* resources should be put towards *delaying it* and buying time.

With defense in depth there is *no single defensive line*. Instead, it focuses on yielding less defended territory in order to waste the resources of the attacker. Once the attacker is weakened, then the defense can mount a counter-strike on their weak points.
## In Cybersecurity
The concept of Defense in Depth is used in many fields, especially ones which have a goal to *avoid critical disaster*. This includes nuclear technology, aerospace, etc..

In cybersecurity the focus of DiD is to *layer* the defense of an organization. Instead of having one defensive line, the strategy is to have multiple security measures in place so that if the first line of defense is breached, additional layers exist to stop and/or delay the adversary.

In information security, the focus is on *redundancy* in three major areas: physical, technical, and administrative.
### Physical
This includes any measures which limit or prevent access to IT infrastructure. It can include fences, guards, sectioning off network devices into locked rooms, etc.
### Technical
These are measures which include hardware and/ or software controls whose purpose is to protect system resources. Some examples are disk encryption, authentication, file integrity software, etc.. 

Hardware controls include anything which prevents access to *the contents of a system* but differ from physical controls. I.e. they don't include protecting the physical device itself.
### Administrative
Administrative controls are the policies and procedures which an organization follows in order to protect its digital resources. This can include employee training, meeting regulation requirements, data handling procedures, etc..
