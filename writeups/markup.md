# PLAN

php server
	use to serve files out of the Admin dir
	testing:
		serve us a privilege resource from
		User/Administrator	


job.bat ** more sure that it escalates
	testing:
		fill it with commands which 
		get us protected files/ resources
			ie. "get the .ssh/ id_rsa
			     from Administrator"
	directory traversal
	
code execution
	
blockers:
		---> sometimes the file we create with job.bat
		is empty
			(my bat code is wrong)
		sometimes job.bat ggets replaces w/ its
		OG content (my bat code gets YEETED)

mysql/ 


phpMyAdmin
	privileged shell?
	privileged php code to execute on the system
		(get system variables/info)
