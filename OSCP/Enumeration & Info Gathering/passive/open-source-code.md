# (PASSIVE) Open Source Code
The following sources and repositories sites for open source code can be used to find juicy bits of information on a target. Searching code hosting sites like [GitHub](https://github.com) for a target domain can help you discover exposed credentials, source code, and at the very least, give you a glimpse into any coding practices the target has. 

Most of the following sources *support Google search operators* (like we learned in [google-dorks](passive/google-dorks.md)). Additionally, some allow for the use of regex to narrow down results. There are also command line tools we can use to automate searching. One such tools is [GitDorks.sh](https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/1fb7ab2409ab579178d2a79959909b33) from Jason Haddix (I also have a version I made which improves Jason's bash script to include regex, you can see it [here](https://github.com/pentestpuppy/gitdork)).

There is also [GitRob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) and [GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)
