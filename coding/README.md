# Coding
This directory contains notes on coding including general concepts, specific languages, frameworks and databases, as wells as associated tools.
## Some Interesting Nuggets:
-  My notes on [coroutines](concepts/coroutines.md)
-  Do [pointers](concepts/pointers.md) confuse you? Maybe I can help...
-  Does [threading](concepts/threading.md) confuse you? It's my favorite coding subject!
- I even have notes on [assembly](languages/assembly.md) & [gdb](gdb.md)!
- But if you're more high-level, here is python [asyncio](languages/python/asyncio.md) & [terraform](terraform.md)
