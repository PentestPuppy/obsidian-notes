# Virtual [LANs](LAN.md) 
Init.
A segmentation technique which logically divide physical networks into *distinct segments*. VLANs are more secure because they isolate traffic and confine them into *Broadcast domains*. This minimizes the scope of potential threats by limiting unauthorized access to data and devices on the VLAN.

VLANs also provide more granular control over networks and devices. Each VLAN can have *specific security policies and access control* as well as traffic isolation.
