# Wide Area Network (WAN)
Init.
A WAN is a collection of [LAN](LAN.md)s which can communicate w/ each other. For example, the internet itself is *the largest WAN*. 
## Components
### WAN Routers
A WAN router is an "edge" or "border" router which routes data b/ WAN locations. It also gives a WAN *access to a carrier network*. 
### SD WAN
Software-defined WAN uses *virtualization* to make deploying WAN environments easier. It uses VMs, application-level policies, overlay networks, and onsite SD-WAN devices.
