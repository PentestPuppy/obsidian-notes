# Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
Init.
IPsec is a network encryption protocol which provides security for IP communication. Each [network layer](../OSI/3-network/network-layer.md) packet is encrypted within a session of communication. This not only obfuscates the data, but also *provides authentication*.
