# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Init.
Networking protocol used to *automatically assign [IP addresses](../../PNPT/PEH/networking/IP-addresses.md)* from a pool of available addresses to devices which connect to the network. DHCP is useful because it takes away the need to *manually assign addresses* to every single device which connects.
## DHCP Exhaustion
Once the IP address pool is depleted of all available addresses, DHCP exhaustion occurs. There are no more addresses available to assign to new connecting devices. There are a few reasons this can happen:
- Network growth
- Misconfiguration
- Rogue or unauthorized devices
- Long Lease Duration
