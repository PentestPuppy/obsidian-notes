# Secure Shell Protocol
A protocol which connects devices and encrypts the traffic between them. *The most common way to connect to and interact with the command line of a remote [Linux](/computers/linux) machine*. Allows you to execute commands on a remote device. Any data sent between the devices over the internet is encrypted and then decrypted by the receiving device.

SSH was created to *replace less secure protocols* like [FTP](FTP.md) and [telnet](telnet.md). Not only does it provide secure communication b/w terminals, but it can also handle *file transfers*.
## Command line
The [ssh](CLI-tools/ssh-command.md) command allows you to connect to devices via ssh.
