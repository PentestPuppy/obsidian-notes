# SRTP Secure Real Time Transport Protocol
Init
Used in VOIP and is the secure version of *RTP* (Realtime Transport Protocol). It ensures *secure, realtime transport of video and audio over an [IP](../OSI/4-transport/transport-layer.md) network.*
## Adds to RTP
SRTP uses encryption to keep conversations private, whereas RTP  does not. 
### AES Encryption
Used to encrypt voice data in a conversation or video
### HMAC-SHA1
Uses this [hash-based](../../computers/concepts/cryptography/hashing.md) encryption method to provide *authentication, integrity, and replay protection.* The hashing algorithm is *SHA1*.
