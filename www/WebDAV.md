# WebDAV
INIT
WebDAV is a set of extensions for [HTTP](HTTP.md) which allows collaborators to write/ create/ modify contents *directly* on a web server. WebDAV provides [concurrency](../coding/concepts/coroutines.md#Concurrency) control and namespace operations so web content can be writeable (and not just readable). It also provides protections against *overwriting* files on the server.
