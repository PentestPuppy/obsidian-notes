# Console vs. Terminal vs. Shell vs. TTY
These terms are all closely related & are often used interchangeably, but are technically different. Console, terminal, and shell all originally referred to a *piece of equipment which you could use to interact with a machine*.

These pieces of equipment used to look a lot like typewriters, hence the term 'teletypewriter' or 'tty'.

## TTY
In Unix a tty is a [device file](/computers/linux/device-file.md). Besides reading and writing, it also implements additional commands called *'ioctls'*
