# Steganography
Obfuscating information by *hiding it in an image*. Comes from the Greek word for 'concealed writing'. Not *truly* secure b/c the message is there, just not easily visible.
## Terms
### Covertext
The container document or file which the secret information is hidden inside.
## Techniques
### Network based
Embedding messages in [TCP](../../../networking/protocols/TCP.md) packets.
### Images
### Watermarks
For example, printer paper sometimes has barely visible yellow dots printed into it. Usually used to hold information about the printer the document was printed from.
### Audio & Video
Similar technique to image steganography; information is interlaced within the audio/ video file by digitally modifying it.
