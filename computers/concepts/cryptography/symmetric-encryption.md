# Symmetric Encryption
With this type of encryption there is *a single key* used to encrypt and decrypt data. Therefor, the algorithm is also called *secret key* or *shared secret* algorithm b/c there is a single key which is needed to decrypt/ encrypt.
## Disadvantages & Advantages
### Doesn't scale
Because there is only one key, it can be difficult to use symmetric encryption since the key has to be shared and/ or transported in some way to whoever is decrypting the data. If multiple people are trying to decrypt the same piece of data, how can you safely distribute the key to each of them?
### Very Fast
W/ symmetric encryption, there is less overhead (than with asymmetric) and less resource drain.
## Examples of Symmetric Encryption Algorithms:
- [AES](AES.md)
- RC4
- 3DES
