# Operating System
Init.
## Components
### Kernel
The kernel of an OS communicates w/ the hardware ([CPU](CPU.md), [memory](computers/memory/memory.md))
### Applications
The other part of the operating system is the applications, which are based on and help run the kernel. *For example* [linux](/computers/linux.md) distros use the same kernel *but implement different applications*
