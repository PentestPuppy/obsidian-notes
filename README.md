# Obsidian Notes
## This is a public repo of my notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
> P.S. the commit history has been wiped due to insecure configuration. This repo was created in December '22

### Viewing this Repo:
The best way to view this collection of notes is with the Obsidian desktop app. The app shows connections, links between topics, and other formatting which can't be appreciated in the markdown alone.

> This is how my notes on [Fast Flux](cybersecurity/TTPs/c2/fast-flux.md) will look on Obsidian Desktop.

If you prefer to browse my notes w/o the help of Obsidian, just know that some markdown formatting will not make sense and will make the notes harder to read.

This repo is for my organization and reference but can be viewed by the public. Feel free to use these notes for your own reference or education. However, I cannot guarantee their accuracy. Thanks! :)

## P.S. Nested Repos!
Check out the [nested-repos](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/tree/main/nested-repos) directory to see sub-folders of my notes which I've contextualized into their own repos!

## P.P.S. Contributing:
If you find flaws and or misinformation in topic notes you'd like me to correct, feel free to make a branch w/ your changes and submit a pull request so I can review them! I want these notes to be accurate and because I'm learning so much so quickly, I'm sure ther are notes which need fixing!
